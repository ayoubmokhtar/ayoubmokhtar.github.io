<h2 id="brief-overview">Brief overview:</h2>

<p>Fear, disappointment, failure with many other bad things have been experienced by most of OSCP holders, It’s not a shame to admit it and if you ask people around regarding its difficulty, you will get various types of answers with one signification. OSCP is the toughest exam they&rsquo;ve taken in their lives. Offensive Security Certified Professional. one of the most well-recognized and respected certifications in the security industry. Comparing it with other certifications, OSCP simulates the real-world attacks and proves that the OSCP holder has mastered a comprehensive and practical understanding of the penetration testing process.</p>

<h2 id="before-i-started">Before I started:</h2>

<p>As a security professional, I have worked on various projects based on Application Security Testing (Web &amp; Network). Actively participating in bug bounty programs and have been acknowledged by organizations like PayPal, Google, eBay, Red hat, Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Dell, and many more for finding security vulnerabilities in their applications. Since I started in this field I have been instructed and mentored by a well-experienced friend, Ayoub Fathi also works as Senior Security Engineer and Technical Security Manager at Noon.</p>

<p>Ayoub Fathi has instructed me and mentored me by making sure I don’t fall in the same mistakes he did by following a straight path to reach the level of a professional, avoiding all time-waste kinds of stuff on the internet by going through all each necessary step.</p>

<p>2nd of October 2018 – This is the day when Fathi instructed me to purchase the Penetration Testing with Kali Linux course and get my Offensive Security Certified Professional Certification. I was too lazy starting it, at the same time I wanted to experience the journey of OSCP labs that everyone in the InfoSec community talks about when most of them describe it as tough and mind-blowing experience.</p>

<p>Before signing up, I did some Googling to learn as much as I could, I read many reviews to get familiar with everything related to this certificate including blogs, course modules, etc. before purchasing anything.</p>

<h2 id="when-i-started">When I started:</h2>

<p>8th of November 2018 – I decided to sign up and pay the fees and reserve a seat for the online Penetration Testing with Kali Linux course. I paid for 60 days of lab access.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/60KoJuIG-Ni29PJwO8CUa9poYiAu0C34dhgy2D2jM6ImFCio9Xj7NOHpDHDiP8K9GUeUuIaiM2XV" alt="enter image description here" /></p>

<p>18th of November 2018 – The lab starts today.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/feAqBE3ajV_KIjWka2WS1XN1MtRBa7jxh4ieN9Hoxna0GTd4zvuvHPMi-MBCQAxDRW2TB7HolLuw" alt="enter image description here" title="2" /></p>

<p>It was a very late time when I received the course materials and the lab connectivity credentials. So, I will need to initially connect via VPN into the student network and hack my way through other additional networks which is: IT, Dev, Admin, even though and as I hopped. I was able to get system access with a fully interactive shell in a matter of minutes when my lab started. that was actually perfect and I thought nothing in here I should be afraid of, my confidence is starting to increase and it&rsquo;s time to set a plan from the lab to the exam.</p>

<p>The plane was as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clearing all hanging fruit first.</li>
<li>Avoiding Metasploit (sometimes I had to use it alongside a proxy to
debug the exploit failure).</li>
<li>A least one machine a day.</li>
<li>Schedule as soon as you feel ready.</li>
</ol>

<p>I slept and I woke up earlier than I usually do, so excited to proceed through this journey. I was sure that I am definitely capable of doing a great job inside the offsec labs. my plan was going as intended until I crossed 25 days with 37 machines that have been compromised, including the most hardest/famous machines PAIN, GHOST, SUFFERANCE, HUMBLE. by doing this I felt too confident that I am going to be able to pass the exam, but to be honest sometimes I don’t. that’s because too many people out there falling the exam even if they were too experienced as a penetration tester. I was so confused about this matter, even though I was just letting it go and hoping for the best.</p>

<p>I took some days off to handle some family matters, I came back to the lab; by then it was just 15 days left for the lab to end. I decided to schedule my first exam attempt. Until then, I thought it may be a good thing if I started writing the lab report. (by the way, I didn’t complete it).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gJJ3VaaT_KOIp-RErE6fRM5nMvUJ3qdjMqXq5sxb-3qY2-Ms4EmaczBM0z-IWrzacCDMrawverOD" alt="enter image description here" /></p>

<p>OSCP Certification examination has students undergo a 24-hour exam, where they must conduct a penetration test or security assessment of an organization. The ultimate goal is for students to compromise the entire network and write a penetration test report afterward, where they demonstrate how they compromised the network. During that time, I was day by day losing confidence, I was scared as hell to not pass, each time I think about the exam, my heart beats very quickly.</p>

<p>15th of January 2019 – The night before, I started feeling like I collapsed. Too many negative thoughts passing through my brain, stayed all night in a hypnagogic hallucinations state. which is something I used to experience before any big day.</p>

<p>The exam started now. I passed the verification process with the exam proctor and I received the VPN connectivity credentials. started to work on the first machine (BOF), and I was done with it quickly. Jumped to the second machine and I started feeling too sleepy. Can’t control my eyes any longer, I tried to take a nap but I couldn’t, I grabbed a big cup of cafe and I came back to the exam and the stress is killing me bad. Wasted 5 hours doing nothing makes sense.</p>

<p>and I finally got the second machine, jumped to the third one and the stress is back again, spending hours trying to enumerate like a dead man, but I stopped I couldn’t handle the situation anymore.</p>

<p>I closed the connection and I ended the exam I went to sleep, the moment I woke up I was so depressed and disappointed. However, I said it was OK, and most of the OSCP holders failed their first attempt. let&rsquo;s reschedule again.</p>

<p>I rescheduled the second attempt.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UVBEDCxOrC3nB9KYR2WI7tlyYzLcdHPduk4DODwUr2ZiV7K2XPKuH_LuSBIn5KlYPVfe4DdC2dHb" alt="enter image description here" /></p>

<p>During that time, I didn’t prepare that much, I was too confident that I have what it takes to pass the exam, but I was willing to complete the lab report to get the extra 5 points. My lab time is expired, and I had to complete the other exercises in my personal lab.</p>

<p>05th of Mars 2019 – The same scenario happened again, a lot of stress and no sleep, but this time I tried to get over it and stay until the exam time-frame gets disconnected. The exam begins, got access to the (25p) buffer overflow machine in less than hour, (10p) second machine in just 30min it was too straight forward with a well-known exploit. (20p) the third machine took me a couple of hours to get a foothold on it, managed to escalate my privileges in 2 hours. Until then I have 55p + 5p (lab report). So, I just need one access as a low privileged user to pass the exam with 70p.</p>

<p>during that time, I was struggling with the stress, no sleep and fair of failure, I spent hours looking for a way to get that 10p, and I did it eventually. Exam time is about to get disconnected. So, I have only one hour to collect as many screenshots as I could to prepare the exam report.</p>

<p>I wasn’t planning to sleep until I complete everything. I sent the reports and waiting for the result. I was too confident that this time I passed the exam.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ga-C_PzfSid43JynCm-Dej1oqOp07qwqedLRzgpj5-h6y3yZBCF4TeJyiIVvSNeiMq98yRJLiC9H" alt="enter image description here" /></p>

<p>I was wrong. I did not pass the exam, I asked for clarification. Turns out I didn’t document all the exercises and my report isn’t complete. They were right, I was too rushed to end the report and I didn’t give it much time and attention.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FsxnPwldz4_wXalvDG1yc0LvZF7YEeuAwWnCRQpFgC3YfBhnvaxvLNkHTKrK3ArYUD7ikfkQK87x" alt="enter image description here" /></p>

<p>Receiving this email was a big shock for me, when I read it I felt like a loser, which makes me depressed for a long time, just staying home, sleeping, watching many episodes of so many different TV shows. Being like that for 15 days without doing nothing useful or trying to get out of this cycle.</p>

<p>In another hand, several personal/financial issues flowed at one time, things are getting crazy in my life when surprisingly shifted from perfect to bad, it’s easy to lose patience, focus when counting down every moment you are wasting, just sending up a prayer and hoping the call gets through.</p>

<p>I needed someone or something to help me get my feet together and have my confidence back. That time, Ayoub was the only option for me, we had a very long conversation about my situation, and he said to me something that really helped me a lot to reschedule again and beating the fear of failure.</p>

<p><em>“The worst that could happen if you fail the exam is, Rescheduling again.”</em></p>

<p>That’s it, he was right, the worst thing is rescheduling again. So, nothing crazy is going to happen. Accordingly, I rescheduled another exam attempt.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dtgac23N0V6dS72Xb3QDX2ZrAccjTk04Pf1fNzmIJ5qeH4ADtw8IO6TLzGTX0-etfQafj1An_RET" alt="enter image description here" /></p>

<p>16th of April 2019 – It was the first time I had enough sleep before any previous exam attempts, I woke up fully prepared and ready to make this attempt be the last one.</p>

<p>The exam started with some stress but nothing I should be worried about; it was controllable. I started the BOF machine and I got it, the 10p machine and I got it too. Now I have 35p I Jumped to the 25p machine, and I managed to get a low privilege shell, jumped to the second 20p machine, and I struggled with it some hours, but I managed to gather the missing pieces and got a low privilege shell, tried to escalate my privileges and I succeeded. 75p I have now. I PASSED.</p>

<p>Let’s try to get more. I got back to the 20p machine and I managed to escalate the privileges as a system. 85p.</p>

<p>It’s time to recheck my screenshots and making sure I didn’t miss anything. I can’t handle the feeling of failing again. I took 6 hours of sleep.</p>

<p>Before my time ends, I woke up and I came back to the 25p machine and tried to escalate my privileges, I succeeded. The exam ended, and I have all the screenshots needed to write my exam report.</p>

<p>I sent my reports, the exam report and the lab report (corrected my mistakes and completed the exercises).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IC3rbKJgb1VmlZ8AmB8w8kk7zeQHDJKqvBeEwRBFkUSEXOe3eKw5eUROtAa-w4X1JeMSq4017p0e" alt="enter image description here" /></p>

<p>they received my exam documentation.</p>

<p>After less than 48 hours I’ve received one of the most important emails in my entire life.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UsPIDQLIL9RZ3b9_eR5WT9Bt7smFu0ivQoi2IeS6Xei_d72Xn9C2J1aEE5Ht5bW-V_ctcjD9fPh0" alt="enter image description here" /></p>

<p>I was so happy about that achievement, I finally did it, and now I can move on with my life and start planning new challenges.</p>

<h2 id="when-i-ended">When I ended:</h2>

<p>Offensive Security Certified Professional, is not an entry-level certification. It won’t teach how/what SSH or FTP or anything stands for basic stuff, if you are a system administrator or an information security professional or a developer looking for a stepping stone into the field of penetration testing, then this course will make you appreciate every penny you spend on it.</p>

<p>The OSCP has shown my inner self, my weaknesses. How to work under pressure, questioning my abilities, all of these things I wasn’t going to discover their existence if I didn’t experience them during my OSCP journey. I learned so many things that I excepted to when I started in the first place. Especially the NOT GIVING UP attitude and you should too.</p>

<p>I wanted to thank everyone, who stood by me during this painful/depressed experience. Especially Ayoub Fathi who is more than just a friend with a real impact on my life, I couldn’t thank him well-enough for everything he did.</p>

<p>Thank you, Offensive Security. for this amazing course and labs.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Introduction: While playing around with SMC platform at paypal.com, I came across an interesting endpoint which doesn’t include CSRF token within its request when you delete a message. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they&rsquo;re currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request.</div>
